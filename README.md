# GameOfLife

In this project, i've made a simulation of the game of life principles.\
Each square represents a cell which can either be dead or alive. \
Here are som basic rules:

**1.** <span style="color:lightgrey">**A dead cell is colored light grey**</span>\
**2.** <span style="color:green">**A living cell is colored green**</span>\
\
**3. Birth is when a dead cell has 3 neighbours. Then it becomes a live cell**\
**4. Survival is when a living cell has 2 or 3 living neighbours. Then it stays alive**\
**5. In all other cases, the cell dies or remains dead of either overcrowding or loneliness**
\
\
In my version of the simulation, you can either press on the cells you wish to make live, or you can\
randomize some living cells from the 'add random cells' button

### Here's a picture of the simulation
